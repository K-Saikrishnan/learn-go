	Take this kiss upon the brow!
	And, in parting from you now,
	Thus much let me avow —
	You are not wrong, who deem
	That my days have been a dream;
	Yet if hope has flown away
	In a night, or in a day,
	In a vision, or in none,
	Is it therefore the less gone?
	All that we see or seem
	Is but a dream within a dream.

	I stand amid the roar
	Of a surf-tormented shore,
	And I hold within my hand
	Grains of the golden sand —
	How few! yet how they creep
	Through my fingers to the deep,
	While I weep — while I weep!
	O God! Can I not grasp
	Them with a tighter clasp?
	O God! can I not save
	One from the pitiless wave?
	Is all that we see or seem
	But a dream within a dream?
